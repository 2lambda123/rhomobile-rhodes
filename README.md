TAU Platform
===

[TAU Platform](http://github.com/tauplatform/tau) is a framework for building locally executing, device-optimized mobile applications for smartphone devices. These applications are optimized for interacting with transactional enterprise application backends. TAU Platform is available for iOS, Android, Windows Mobile, Windows Phone 8, Windows CE, and BIG Windows (XP, 7, 8).  
TAU Platform is fork of [Rhodes Platform](http://github.com/rhomobile/rhodes)
TAU Platform is available as an open source product under the MIT license.

## Introduction  

TAU Platform takes much of its inspiration from web-oriented MVC style frameworks such as Ruby on Rails. However it has several simplifications and optimizations for the mobile scenario. Some of these are to make it easier for the developer. Most of them are to keep the framework as lightweight as possible to be able to run on mobile devices with limited memory. As with developing apps on any good app framework (Rails, Merb, Django), building a TAU Platform mobile application consists of building a set of files and putting them into the right directories for the respective models.

## Installing TAU Platform

Install TAU Platform:

	$ gem install rhodes

## Generating an Application

TAU Platform features an application generator called 'tau' that generates a controller and views for a given model.  The syntax for running TAU Platform is:

	$ tau app appname

This will generate a new directory called `appname` with several application files.

## Generate a Model and Associated Controller and Templates

	$ cd appname
	$ tau model modelname options

This will generate a model file, controller file, and several views (corresponding to the actions below). Each TAU model has several actions to perform basic CRUD (create, read, update and delete) on the object generated by default by the scaffold . Specifically the template views generated are:

    * index - to list all objects
    * new - to display the editing form for creating a new object
    * edit - to edit the actual object
    * show - to show the object attributes
